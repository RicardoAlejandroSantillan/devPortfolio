      "description": "I am a software developer with a recent focus on Data Science. I have worked with .NET, SQL Server, and automation, but in 2025 I began a formal transition towards data analysis and modeling. I have explored real challenges such as the WiDS 2022 datathon (breast cancer detection) and WiDS 2025 (ADHD detection in women). I am currently training in various data science tools with the goal of building complete end-to-end projects by early 2026. My solid engineering background allows me to approach data science from a practical, structured, and product-oriented perspective."
